C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO
Overview
This C project delves into the fundamental concepts of Stacks and Queues, exploring the contrasting principles of Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) and First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structures. It's designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of how these structures operate, their implementations in C, and their real-world applications.

Features
Stacks Implementation: Explore the mechanics of a stack, where the last element added is the first to be removed.
Queues Implementation: Understand the workings of a queue, following the First-In-First-Out principle.
Functionality: Detailed functions enabling manipulation, insertion, and deletion of elements in both stacks and queues.
Algorithmic Insights: Dive into the algorithms governing the behavior of these data structures, understanding their efficiencies and optimal use cases.
Usage
The project offers a series of C files encapsulating the functionalities of Stacks and Queues. Developers can interact with these structures, testing and utilizing the implemented operations to comprehend their behavior and intricacies.

How to Use
Clone the Repository: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine.
Compile: Use a C compiler to compile the provided source files.
Execute: Run the compiled executable to explore and experiment with stacks and queues.
